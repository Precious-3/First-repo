# Hello
For learnig.

Hey i am committing a change. This is the very first repo i created so i will keep it updated <3

today i decided to transform my first repository on GitHub to include my reading list of books. I'll write the books i read, the books i am currently reading and the topics i want to read about.

## Old books:

1) Mother: by maxim Gorky. i was still a teenage back then. it was a big book for me to read. i didn't finish reading it. also i remember that i downloaded it again to finish reading it. but i haven't yet :p

2) Seeing: by JosÃ© Saramago, the Portuguese author and my favourite, the one that makes me feel it cannot be a coincidence to come across his books. i read "Seeing", "Blindness" and other of his books. namely: "The Bible according to Jesus", "Duplicate Man or Homem Duplicado", also i read part of "All names" and more of his novels. but didn't finish reading the rest of his books.


3)
